## Problem Statement:  
The project aims to make a movie suggestion system using MovieLens data. It will solve the 
problem of starting with new users or items by suggesting movies based on their content or using 
a mix of methods. It will consider things like the time of day or where the user is to suggest good 
movies. The system will also suggest new movies that match what users like. It will explain why 
it suggests certain movies and use various kinds of data to make suggestions. The system will work 
fast and handle a lot of users, making sure it is fair and does not show biased suggestions.
